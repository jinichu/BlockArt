# BlockArt

BlockArt is a blockchain drawing application where art nodes (clients) can connect to a BlockArt miner and draw shapes on a global canvas. In order to draw shapes, ink is 'spent' and the amount of ink a shape requires to be drawn is given by the size of the shape. An art node's ink level is dependent on the miner that it's connected to. A miner obtains ink by mining blocks in the blockchain, or by deleting shapes that it has previously drawn. By successfully computing the nonce, a miner is rewarded ink for that block. Each miner in the BlockArt system ensures that the shapes an art node is attempting to draw is valid (art node has enough ink), that the operation is from the correct art node (by verifying the operation's signature and the art node's public key), and that the shape doesn't overlap with other shapes on the global canvas (unless the overlapping shapes belong to the same art node).
